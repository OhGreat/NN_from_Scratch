# Neural Network from scratch
Small library of neural networks created from scratch with python and numpy. Created to learn how gradient descent and backpropagation work in order to train a model.
The networks are then tested by teaching them to emulate the XOR logic gate.

## Installation

Install python 3 and numpy >=1.19

## Usage

``` 
python XOR_experiment.py
```
